# DigitalCard
A website for sending digital postcards to your friends

## What is this?
This project was a 3-day challenge for myself to finish something and present it to the world.
It is a website for creating and sharing digital postcards with real-time rendered shader backgrounds.
You can go to https://digipost.fun and try it out :D

## Was AI used?
Much of this was new to me when I started, so I used various AIs to learn and make progress on this project.
However, there was no AI involved when creating the shaders and website optics. I only used them for implementing the shader rendering and deploying the project, as that was new to me.

## What will come in the future?
I plan to add more shaders as well as make the website prettier and more user-friendly.
